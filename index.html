        const originalText = "The development of machine learning has transformed how we approach complex problems in computer science. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain's architecture, consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers. Each connection has an associated weight that determines its importance. During training, these weights are adjusted through backpropagation to minimize prediction errors. Deep learning extends this concept by employing multiple hidden layers, enabling the network to learn hierarchical features. Convolutional neural networks excel at image processing by applying filters to detect patterns regardless of their position. Meanwhile, recurrent neural networks handle sequential data by maintaining an internal memory state. Transformers, introduced in 2017, revolutionized natural language processing by replacing recurrence with attention mechanisms that weigh the importance of each element in a sequence. This innovation has led to breakthroughs in machine translation, text generation, and question answering systems. Despite these advances, challenges remain in areas such as interpretability, data efficiency, and robustness to adversarial examples.";
